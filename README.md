# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow.  The `factorialBug.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that will crash for sufficiently large inputs due to excessive recursion depth.

The solution, `factorialSolution.py`, demonstrates how to avoid this by using iteration instead of recursion.
